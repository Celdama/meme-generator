# State

"State" refers to values that are manager by the component, similar to variables declared inside a function. Any time you have changing values that should be saved/displayed, you'll likely be using state.

# Props

"Props" refers to the properties being passed into a component in order for it to work correctly, similar to how a function receives parameters: "from above". A component receiving props is not allowed to modify those props. (i.e they are "immutable")
